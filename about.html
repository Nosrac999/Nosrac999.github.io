        <p class="abouttext">My name is Carson Brough and I am a student at Crimson Cliffs Highschool. I have been going to school since I was the age of 4. I have learned a lot through my years, and I am very grateful for it. School has taught me how to work hard and do things even when I don't want to do them. I currently hold a 4.0 GPA, and am a part of the High School Wrestling Team.</p>
